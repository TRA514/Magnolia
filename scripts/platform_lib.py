"""The single OS-abstraction seam for Magnolia.

Everything platform-specific (package managers, persistence mechanisms, opening
a URL) funnels through here so the rest of the engine stays platform-blind.

macOS is run-validated on the dev machine. Windows branches are written and
unit-tested against a mocked os_kind() but are DESIGN-VALIDATED, NOT
RUN-VALIDATED (no Windows box available).
